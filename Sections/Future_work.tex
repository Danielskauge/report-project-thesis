\subsection{Jump Performance Analysis}
The upcoming master's thesis will investigate activating hip and knee motors during spring-powered jumps to improve performance and enable feedback control for handling sim-to-real gaps. This combined actuation may lead to different optimal link lengths. The thesis will also evaluate jumping performance in Simscape using the A80BHP-H motors, which provide twice the torque and speed of current motors, to determine if they should be incorporated into the design. We will also perform physical tests to see if the knee motors are able to provide stall torque for long enough to load springs maximally.

\subsection{Hardware Implementation}
The thesis will build and test the refined robot design. The shank design will be modified to minimize the moment arm between the shank end and hip abduction axis, eliminating undesired motor loads during jumps. We will also add elastic elements to absorb landing impacts.

\subsection{Control} 
We will develop an accurate model in Nvidia Isaac Sim to train deep reinforcement learning controllers for jumping, stabilization, and landing. Domain randomization will help transfer policies from simulation to hardware, while curriculum learning will help the learning process. The policies will then be deployed and validated on the physical robot.
