\subsection{Motor Friction Estimation}
\label{sec:results:motor_friction_estimation}
Figures \ref{fig:results:motor_friction_estimation:pendulum_large} and \ref{fig:results:motor_friction_estimation:pendulum_small} compare the measured pendulum angles against simulations using two friction models: one with only viscous friction and one with both viscous and Coulomb friction. Table \ref{tab:results:motor_friction_parameters} presents the estimated friction parameters and Mean Squared Error (MSE) between simulated and measured angles for both motors.

The combined viscous-Coulomb model achieves better accuracy, particularly in the later phases of motion where angular velocities are lower. This aligns with expectations, as Coulomb friction becomes more dominant relative to viscous friction at lower speeds. The MSE values confirm this improved performance, as the MSE with Coulomb is about 1/3 of the MSE without Coulomb for both motors% for both motors.

\subsection{Link Length Optimization}
\label{sec:results:link_length_optimization}
Grid search results for Earth and Mars gravity are shown in figures \ref{fig:results:grid_search_earth} and \ref{fig:results:grid_search_mars}. The search explored link length ratios \(\frac{L_1}{L_2}\) from 0.8 to 1.6 and total lengths \(L_1 + L_2\) from 10 cm to 36 cm, in increments of 0.1 and 1 cm respectively.

For both gravitational environments, a link length ratio of 1.0 yields optimal performance across all total lengths. The optimal total length in Mars gravity (28 cm) exceeds Earth gravity (20 cm) by 8 cm, achieving a 102.4 cm greater maximum jump height.

Jump performance degrades rapidly for ratios below 1.0, but declines more gradually above 1.0. The effective jump height is less steep in the total length dimension around the optimal point, allowing flexibility in length selection with minimal performance impact. The performance landscape is non-convex, containing a secondary peak centered at \(\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 1.3\)-1.4 and total length ≈ 24 cm for Earth gravity, and at \(\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 1.5\) and total length ≈ 35 cm for Mars gravity.

Table \ref{tab:results:grid_search:best_jumps} summarizes the optimal parameters and their performance.

\subsection{Hip Motor Dimensioning Test}
\label{sec:hip_motor_dimensioning_test}

As can be seen in figure \ref{fig:hip_motor_strength_test}, the hip motors follow the angle reference well, achieving three back and forth swings of 90 degrees over a one second period. The torque output of the motors during this maneuver can be seen in figure \ref{fig:hip_motor_torque_test}. In other words, the hip motors satisfy the heuristic as presented in \cite{finn_tarek_master}.

\subsection{Motor Only Jumping Results}
\label{sec:results_motor_only_jumps}

As described in section \ref{sec:design_motor_only_jumps}, motor-only simulations were done using the assumed characteristics of the A80BHP-H motor. Because the results were so far from acceptable, only the results of one experiment are presented here, but simulations with shorter leg and body lengths were performed. Figure \ref{fig:joint_speed_A80BHM} shows the knee joint actuation torque, knee joint velocity and knee joint angle during takeoff for the A80BHP-H motor. The robot is not able to reach a high enough speed to achieve a good jump, and the peak body center of mass height reached is 70cm, despite a total leg length of 40cm.
% TODO: INclude below in results
%. These motors were chosen due to their high torque to weight ratio. While extensive testing was done, the jumping performance was so far from acceptable that the idea was abandoned, and the full scope of the experiments are considered outside the scope of this report. The best jumping performance was achieved with the A80BHP-H motor from AGF-RC. This motor has a stall torque of 18.5 kg/cm, a weight of 80 grams, and a maximum velocity of 2000 degrees per second. To test jumping performance, the robots dimensions were gradually increased, body length as well as link lengths. This gradual increase was terminated when the body length reached 30cm and the thigh and shank links reached 20cm each, for a total leg length of 40cm. The search was terminated here because the robot was still not jumping satisfactorily, despite the robots dimensions having reached a point where they were considered excessive. Primarily because the body mass was not being scaled with the general dimensions of the robot, and because the jump height was also not increasing at a commensurate rate with the increase in robot size. Ie., even though the total center of mass displacement was increasing, the center of mass jump height compared to the total length of the legs was not increasing, and the robot was thus not jumping higher. The achieved velocity of the knee joint until takeoff can be seen in figure \ref{fig:joint_speed_A80BHM}. As can be seen, the motor torque drops quickly, and is not able to reach a high enough speed to achieve a good jump. In fact, the peak body center of mass height reached is 70cm, despite a total leg length of 40cm. As can be seen, the motor is too slow to reach a high enough joint velocity for a good jump, it is therefore unlikely that a faster but weaker motor would perform much better. Efforts were made to test motors with both higher torques and higher speeds, but no motors were found with similar specs without being significantly heavier and larger. TODO: Should I show some motors that are objectively worse, as an example?
