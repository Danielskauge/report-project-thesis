\section{Reflection on UN Sustainable Development Goals}
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for global action to protect the planet and eradicate poverty, promoting peace and prosperity for all.

\subsection{Goal 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth}
This project contributes to advancing the autonomous capabilities of robots, driving economic growth by improving efficiency and productivity across various sectors, including space exploration and planetary research. While technological advancements create jobs in tech-driven industries like robotics and aerospace, it's crucial to acknowledge that manual labor jobs may be replaced by autonomous machines in the future.

\subsection{Goal 9 - Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure} 
Autonomous robots, as products of innovation, enhance industrial efficiency, reduce operational costs, and optimize space infrastructure development. The project's focus on low-gravity locomotion and robust mechanical design advances capabilities for constructing and maintaining infrastructure on other planets. These developments drive broader innovations in actuation, sensing and robotic mobility that benefit terrestrial applications.
