\section{Robot Design}
\label{sec:robot_design}

This is where we explain "overall" design. It's motivation, etc. 
Also where we cover dimensioning, link-lengths, etc. 
We explain here our parameter sweep to find optimal design. 
We also explain here our kinematics-script that we used to derive the required stall-torque for our motor given springs and link-lengths.
