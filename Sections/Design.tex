\section{Robot Design}
\label{sec:robot_design}

This is where we explain "overall" design. It's motivation, etc. 
Also where we cover dimensioning, link-lengths, etc. 
We explain here our parameter sweep to find optimal design. 
We also explain here our kinematics-script that we used to derive the required stall-torque for our motor given springs and link-lengths. 

\subsection{The Single Vertical Manipulator Jump Model}

In the absence of air resistance, which is negligible for a robot like this during a jumping maneuver like this, the factor that determines jumping distance is body velocity at takeoff. To keep things simple, in the following will be given an example where the sole goal is to maximize vertical jump height. Further, only a one leg robot with a 2 DOF leg with equal link lengths is considered. 

For a robot such as the one described above, the position of the paw relative to the body can be described by the standard 2 link manipulator equation as seen in equation \ref{eq:2_link_manipulator}, in accordance with the theory in section \ref{sec:robot_kinematics}. For this simple robot, it is assumed that the optimal jump is one where the body center of mass and paw position move in opposite directions, with velocities strictly along the up/down y axis. This example is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:vertical_manipulator}. As is obvious from the figure and from the kinematics, for such a jump $\theta_1 = -\frac{(\theta_2+\pi)}{2}$, and $\dot{\theta}_2=-2\dot{\theta}_1$. If this is combined with the jacobian for the end effector, given in equation \ref{eq:jacobian_vertical_jump_leg}, one can plot the vertical velocity of the paw as a function of the knee angle $\theta_2$, this is shown in figure \ref{fig:vertical_jacobian_velocity}. This is done using the jacobian as in equation \ref{eq:jacobian_speed_mapping}. 

As can be seen in figure \ref{fig:vertical_jacobian_velocity}, the joint velocity of the leg much more readily translates to body velocity when the knee is crouched. Without giving a detailed derivation, the intuition meant to be gained from figure \ref{fig:vertical_jacobian_velocity} is that how quickly the leg joints are accelerated can be just as important as the speed it is accelerated to. This has an important interpretation for the choice of motors, in the sense that, if a given motor is unable to accelerate the leg joints quickly enough, there is little sense in looking for a faster motor, unless it is also stronger.

Initially, experiments were done utilizing motors alone. Due to the need for a light and strong motor, initially a series of AGF-RC motors were looked at, due to their high torque to weight ratio. As covered in section \ref{sec:motor_modeling}, a motor model consisting of a stall torque and a max velocity, with a linear decrease in max torque between these two, was chosen. For the AGF-RC motors, their provided stall torque and operating speed were used as for the motor model parameters. Attempts were made to get more information about the motors' performance characteristics, but the supplier, AGF-RC, was unable to provide more detailed information. While extensive testing was done with various motors, the jumping performance was so far from acceptable that the idea was abandoned, and the full scope of the experiments are considered outside the scope of this report.

More details about the results of the motor only jumps can be found in section \ref{sec:results_motor_only_jumps}, but a brief overview of the reasoning involved will be given here. The most relevant of the motors chosen for these experiments was the A80BHP-H motor by AGFRC, which was chosen because it had both the highest stall torque and operating speed of all the AGF-RC motors. Attempts were made to identify motors with similar stall torques and operating speeds in the same weight range, but none were found. The experiments using the A80BHP-H were therefore, to a certain degree, considered an "optimistic estimate". Since no satisfactory results were achieved with the A80BHP-H motor, as discussed in section \ref{sec:results_motor_only_jumps}, it was decided to explore alternatives to motor-only actuation. 

The tests with the A80BHP-H motor were done by providing the knee motors with reference torques equal to their max torque, with the motor model limiting the resultant torque to more realistic values. Meanwhile, the hip joints were actuated according to the control law seen in \ref{eq:friction_cone_limit} to limit slipping. Despite the zero velocity/equilibria assumptions of equation \ref{eq:force_torque_mapping}, as presented in section \ref{sec:force_torque_mapping}, obviously not holding for this dynamic jumping scenario, very little slipping was observed in practice. 

\begin{align}
    N &= \text{Normal force} \\
    \mu &= \text{friction coefficient} = 0.8 \\
    \tau_{\text{friction cone limit}} &= J^T 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        N \mu \\
        0
    \end{bmatrix} \\
    \max(|\tau_{knee}|) &= \tau_{\text{friction cone limit}}
    \label{eq:friction_cone_limit}
\end{align}

Using this control law, jumping for variously dimensioned robots were attempted. As covered in section \ref{sec:results_motor_only_jumps}, none of them were satisfactory. Tests were eventually terminated, as no and body link length configuration was capable of jumping satisfactorily. By satisfactorily, it is meant that the robot center of mass cleared the ground by a distance more than twice that of the leg length, ie., if the legs are 20cm long, the center of mass should clear the ground by at least 40cm. 

For comparisons between this motor-only jumping and later spring+motor jumping, it is worth mentioning that the spring-motor jumping is done not with the A80BHP-H motors, but with weaker and slower motors, as well as with more realistic motor friction models. The reason the A80BHP-H motors were not used for the spring-motor jumping simulations, is that the motor supplier's website (AGF-RC) stated an operating travel range of 90 degrees. This was assumed to be correct, as other AGF-RC motors with stated operating ranges of 180 degrees have had actual mechanical limits of 220 degrees, so such a limitation was not considered out of the ordinary. Later consultations with the supplier's website revealed conflicting information regarding the operating range of the A80BHP-H motor, and direct contact with the supplier revealed that the motor is in fact not limited to 90 degrees of travel. For this reason, potential use of the A80BHP-H motor for the spring-motor jumping is discussed in the future work section, section \ref{sec:future_work}. Despite this at the time believed limitation, the A80BHP-H motor was still used to ascertain the feasibility of motor-only jumping. This was done to provide a "best case scenario" for motor-only jumping, if results were poor for a motor better than any actual existing motor, it would be reasonable to assume that motor-only jumping is not feasible.

% TODO: INclude below in results
%. These motors were chosen due to their high torque to weight ratio. While extensive testing was done, the jumping performance was so far from acceptable that the idea was abandoned, and the full scope of the experiments are considered outside the scope of this report. The best jumping performance was achieved with the A80BHP-H motor from AGF-RC. This motor has a stall torque of 18.5 kg/cm, a weight of 80 grams, and a maximum velocity of 2000 degrees per second. To test jumping performance, the robots dimensions were gradually increased, body length as well as link lengths. This gradual increase was terminated when the body length reached 30cm and the thigh and shank links reached 20cm each, for a total leg length of 40cm. The search was terminated here because the robot was still not jumping satisfactorily, despite the robots dimensions having reached a point where they were considered excessive. Primarily because the body mass was not being scaled with the general dimensions of the robot, and because the jump height was also not increasing at a commensurate rate with the increase in robot size. Ie., even though the total center of mass displacement was increasing, the center of mass jump height compared to the total length of the legs was not increasing, and the robot was thus not jumping higher. The achieved velocity of the knee joint until takeoff can be seen in figure \ref{fig:joint_speed_A80BHM}. As can be seen, the motor torque drops quickly, and is not able to reach a high enough speed to achieve a good jump. In fact, the peak body center of mass height reached is 70cm, despite a total leg length of 40cm. As can be seen, the motor is too slow to reach a high enough joint velocity for a good jump, it is therefore unlikely that a faster but weaker motor would perform much better. Efforts were made to test motors with both higher torques and higher speeds, but no motors were found with similar specs without being significantly heavier and larger. TODO: Should I show some motors that are objectively worse, as an example?

\subsection{Actuation Method Selection: Motors and Torsional Spring}

The next actuation method considered was to use a combination of motors and torsional springs, as this is the design we ended up choosing, a CAD model of this design can be seen in figure \ref{fig:assembly_CAD}. With this design, the knee motors are used to compress the torsional springs, once the knee joint reaches a desired angle, ie. has stored the desired amount of energy, the motors are turned off, and the springs accelerate the legs joints quickly enough for the robot to take off. Results from simulations are presented in section \ref{sec:results_motor_only_jumps_with_spring}, but in short, jumping performance was superior to that of the motor-only jumps. Tests were done both with and without motor friction. Due to the absence of known motor friction parameters, they were initially performed with assumed zero friction. Later tests, with motor friction parameters estimated based on physical experiments, are described in more detail in TODO, link length section, and results presented in TODO: link length results section. 

%The choice to use torsional springs in the knee only, rather than in both the hip and knee joints, was made in accordance to the goals stated in section \ref{sec:motivation}, ie. to make a robot that can jump, without excessively limiting its general utility as a quadruped. It is the belief of the authors that a normal walking gait, without having to compress or extend the torsional springs in the knees, could easily be achieved by introducing a mechanical slack that must be exceeded before the knee springs are compressed. This is however considered beyond the scope of this project, as this robot is only intended to jump. Comparatively, springs in the hips would affect things such as attitude stabilization

\subsection{Actuation Method Selection: Motors and Extension Spring}

In addition to the torsional spring design, attempts were made to design a leg utilizing an extension spring. The resulting design is shown in figure \ref{fig:extension_spring_CAD}. Although experiments akin to the ones done for torsional springs were done with comparable results, the extension spring design was ultimately abandoned. The reason for this was pure geometrical constraints, which are discussed in section \ref{sec:extension_spring_design}. Because the extension spring design was abandoned, the details surrounding the extension spring simulations and simulation results are considered outside the scope of this report.

\subsection{Hip Motor Strength Requirements}

While the main purpose of the designed robot is to be proficient at jumping, the inclusion of torsional knee springs as a major part of the actuation method, and the subsequent lessened importance of the hip motors for jumping, complicated the choice of hip motors. From \cite{finn_tarek_master}
