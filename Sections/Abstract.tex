\section*{Abstract}

This specialization project involves the development of a concept design for a small, lightweight, and low-cost jumping quadruped robot, which jumps by releasing the energy stored in torsional springs embedded in parallel to the robots knee motor. The purpose of the robot is to be capable of jumping long distances in earth gravity, and to be used as a platform for testing quadruped jumping control algorithms. This goal must be seen in the context of the potential utility of jumping quadrupeds for extraterrestrial exploration, where they could traverse obstacles that would be insurmountable to wheeled rovers. The robot is designed to be small and lightweight to reduce the risk of damage during testing, and low-cost to make it more accessible to researchers. In addition to the general concept design, this report presents a Simulink Simscape simulation of the robot, used to evaluate various design choices. The report also presents a detailed CAD model for the spring-actuated leg, as well as an experiment-based system identification of the gear-friction of the selected motors. Using the identified friction characteristics of the motor, our simulations indicate a potential center of mass jump height of 0.5m for a robot with a total leg length of 20cm. TODO add the precise newest number.
