This specialization project presents the concept design of a small, lightweight jumping quadruped robot optimized for jumps in low gravity environments, which uses torsional springs mounted parallel to knee motors for energy storage and release. This work is motivated by the exploration of Martian lava tubes and other challenging extraterrestrial terrains where traditional wheeled rovers face mobility limitations. The robot is designed to be a platform for developing and testing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) policies for jumping, aerial stabilization, and landing. The robot is designed to be lightweight and low-cost to reduce the risk and cost of damage during testing. Through Simulink Simscape simulations we demonstrate that pure motor actuation is insufficient for achieving significant jump heights, and that parallel torsional springs significantly increase the jump height. Grid search optimization reveals that equal-length leg segments maximize jump height, with maximum jump height of 1.18m in mars gravity and 0.5m in Earth gravity. The project delivers a detailed CAD model of the spring-actuated leg design, establishing the foundation for hardware implementation and control development in the subsequent master's thesis. While several challenges remain, including the lack of feedback control during jumps, the design shows promise for enabling agile locomotion in Martian lava tubes and other challenging extraterrestrial terrains.
