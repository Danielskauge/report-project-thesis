\section{Robot Hardware}

This is where we discuss actual hardware, ie. component selection, materials, CAD, etc. 

So here we specify motors and how they match specs, while referring to the design section to explain why we want these motors. We should here have a list of existing motors. The design section can link to this list to motivate its own choice. It will be circular, but that's okay.
